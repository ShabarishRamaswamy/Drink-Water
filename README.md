# Drink-Water
This is a Chrome extension which reminds you to drink water at your specified time.

It is important to drink water at regular intervals, especially when working or studying. Thus, I have created this extension to remind users to drink water at their own optimum intervals.

Users can use this either as a water interval or even a stopwatch if they want to.

This is a FOSS and simple extension. Have fun and Drink Water !
