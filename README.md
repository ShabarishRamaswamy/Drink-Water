# Drink-Water
This is a Chrome extension which reminds you to `Drink Water` at your specified time.

It is important to drink water at regular intervals, especially when working or studying. Thus, I have created this extension to remind users to drink water at their own optimum intervals.

Users can use this either as a water interval timer or even a stopwatch if they want to.

This is a FOSS and a simple extension. Have fun and **Drink Water !**

# How to Use ?
Install the extension using the instructions given below.

`Pin` the extension if not done so already.

Now, click the extension.

</p>
  
Here, you can set the time and click on Save.

When you reopen the extension the timer would have been set to your preference !

</p>

Then extension will now have this icon when the timer expires and it wants you to Drink Water !
